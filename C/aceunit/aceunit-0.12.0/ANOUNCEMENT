ANOUNCEMENT

In future versions of AceUnit, the following eventually incompatible changes
will be performed:
* ACEUNIT_EMBEDDED will be renamed.
* The id will change.
  Old: normal id = string, ACEUNIT_EMBEDDED id = number.
  New: normal id = number, ACEUNIT_EMBEDDED id = number.
       The string will be separately available.
* The runner will optionally support ids for selecting suites, fixtures and
  test cases.
* The group feature implementation will be completed.

The changes will not affect tests.
The changes might affect invocations of the runner and the build environment.
