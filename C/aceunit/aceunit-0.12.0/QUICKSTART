QUICKSTART
==========

This is a quick start guide to AceUnit.

AceUnit is easy, so this only 3 steps.


Step 1: Read the documentation.
AceUnit consists of more comment lines than code lines.
The developers took a lot of care that AceUnit is well-documented.
If you have a question, try to find the answer in the documentation.
Basically everything is there.
And especially look at the tests.
The tests are perfect examples of how to use and integrate AceUnit.

Step 2: Never modify AceUnit.
Do not modify AceUnit.
Don't do that.
AceUnit is designed to be easy yet flexible and extensible without modifying it.
If you modify AceUnit, you will increase your own effort of upgrading to a newer version of AceUnit.
If you think you need to modify AceUnit, you should rather contact the AceUnit developers.
They can support you.
They can change AceUnit in a way that your extension becomes possible without modifying AceUnit.
Or, if your extension is useful, they can implement your idea in AceUnit.

Step 3: Use AceUnit.
How to use it should be clear from Step 1.
Again, take a look at the tests.
The tests are perfect examples of how to use and integrate AceUnit.


Hints:
* Make your build find the AceUnit sources.
* You need to compile AceUnit.c and AceUnitData.c plus a Logger of your choice.
* Don't forget to add AceUnit to the include path.
* Invoke the AceUnit generator (AceUnit*.jar).
