#ifndef ACEUNIT_H
/** Include shield to protect the header file from being included more than once. */
#define ACEUNIT_H 1

/** AceUnit header file.
 * You do not need to include this header file in a fixture.
 * The generated header file for your fixture will automatically include it.
 *
 * The following options are supported:
 * <dl>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_EMBEDDED</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Define this macro if you want to use AceUnit in embedded mode.
 *      Using AceUnit in embedded mode will use test element ids that are <code>uint16_t</code> instead of <code>char*</code>.
 *      Memory consumption in embedded mode is significantly reduced.
 *      Some non-vital features are not available in embedded mode.
 *      TODO: describe which features are not available in embedded mode.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_C_MODE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Set this macro to explicitely specify how AceUnit shall interact with the compiler environment regarding header files.
 *      The following options are possible:
 *      <dl>
 *          <dt><code>ACEUNIT_C_MODE_C99_INCLUDES</code> (default in a C99 environment)</dt>
 *          <dd>This tells AceUnit to include files like <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code> to define required symbols like <code>uint16_t</code> or <code>NULL</code>.</dd>
 *          <dt><code>ACEUNIT_C_MODE_C89</code> (default in a C89 environment)</dt>
 *          <dd>This tells AceUnit that neither C99 include files nor replacement definitions are available, so AceUnit shall use its own definitions.<7dd>
 *          <dt><code>ACEUNIT_C_MODE_PROPRIETARY</code></dt>
 *          <dd>This tells AceUnit to assume that the required definitions for symbols like <code>uint16_t</code> or <code>NULL</code> are provided by header files already included by the user before the AceUnit header files.</dd>
 *      </dl>
 *      If you use non-C99 compilers, you should bug your compiler vendor to produce an ISO/IEC 9899/1999 (aka ISO C99) compiler.
 *      As you can correctly guess from this description or have read elsewhere, AceUnit works without problems on C89 compilers.
 *      But it's a shame that even today, about a decade after the release of C99, still only a small minority of compilers actually properly support that standard.
 *      <p>
 *      Note: this replaces ACEUNIT_INTERNAL_ISO_TYPES and ACEUNIT_SKIP_ISO_DEFINES from previous versions of AceUnit.
 *      <p>
 *      Note: If you do not set this macro, AceUnit will make the decision itself.
 *            The default is to assume ACEUNIT_C_MODE_C99_INCLUDES for a C99 environment, ACEUNIT_C_MODE_C89 otherwise.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_STATIC_ANNOTATIONS</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Define this macro to make AceUnit annotations (#A_Test, #A_Before, #A_After, #A_BeforeClass, #A_AfterClass, #A_Ignore) behave like the <code>static</code> keyword.
 *      That way you have easy and flexible control whether or not test methods are static.
 *      <p>
 *      Declaring test methods as static has a significant advantage.
 *      You will be able to use the same name in different fixtures and still build and run them all together.
 *      For logging, it is not required that test methods have unique names.
 *      Logging will always also include the associated fixture (e.g. filename + line number).
 *      So you will always uniquely identify which test case filed, even if the names of the test cases are not unique.
 *      <p>
 *      However, there are debuggers which will cause head ache if you try to debug functions which are static.
 *      Some tool chains (compilers / linkers) will not emit proper debug information for functions which are static.
 *      <p>
 *      The pros and cons for static test methods are both very significant.
 *      Whether or not you want to use static depends on your environment.
 *      Because of that, we've left the choice to you.
 *      <p>
 *      But we've prepared everything for you.
 *      Toggling between these two options is as simple as (not) defining this macro.
 *      Of course, toggling static off will only be that simple in the real world if the test method names are unique across all fixtures that you link together.
 *      <p>
 *      If you're unsure, a rule of thumb is define either <code>ACEUNIT_EMBEDDED</code> or <code>ACEUNIT_STATIC_ANNOTATIONS</code> but not both.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_CODE_INCLUDE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Include this header file before AceUnit Code (only applies to framework, not to test cases / generated code).
 *      Use this if you need to specify section information for your compiler e.g. in an embedded environment.
 *      <p>
 *      Of course you could just modify the AceUnit source code to include the section information.
 *      But it is not recommended to modify the AceUnit source code because it will cause extra work for you if you want to upgrade to a newer version of AceUnit.
 *      Therefore we tried to design AceUnit in a way that you shouldn't need to modify AceUnit's source code to get AceUnit running in your environment.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_DATA_INCLUDE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Include this header file before AceUnit Data (only applies to framework, not to test cases / generated code).

 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_DATA_ON_STACK</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Define this macro to use AceUnit Data on the Stack.
 *      You will then have to initialize #runnerData yourself.
 *      AceUnit doesn't automatically put it on the stack itself because you might want to access the results from where you invoked the runner.

 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_SUITES</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Define this macro to use AceUnit with support for Suites.

 *      If you want AceUnit to execute code after every afterclass method, define this macro with that code.

 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_RUNNERDATA_EXTENSION</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      If you want to add additional data to the data available to the runner, define this macro.
 *      The macro should expand to valid fields in a structure.
 *      These fields will be inserted at the end of #AceUnitRunnerData_t.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_CONFIG_FILE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      If you want to configure AceUnit more comfortably than with defines passed via make to your compiler, you can define this macro.
 *      The macro then must evaluate to a valid include file.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_SETJMP_INCLUDE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      If you want AceUnit to use setjmp / longjmp but want it to include a different file than <code>&lt;setjmp.h&gt;</code>, define this macro.
 *      The macro then must evaluate to a valid include file.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_SKIP_SETJMP_INCLUDE</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      If you want AceUnit to use setjmp / longjmp but do not want AceUnit to automatically include any file for it, define this macro.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_LOOP</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      This feature enables <code>A_Loop</code> annotation support.
 *      <code>A_Loop</code> support is independent of the generator.
 *      You may turn <code>A_Loop</code> support on and off during compile time without having to rerun the generator.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_EXPLICIT_MESSAGES</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      This feature enables explicit message support.
 *      That means assertions which have an expected and an actual value will report those values.
 *      For this feature to work, a message buffer which can be used by snprintf is required.
 *      Currently, only snprintf is supported.
 *      sprintf and _snprintf are not yet supported.
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><code>ACEUNIT_EXPLICIT_MESSAGES_INLINE_BUFFER</code></dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      This means that the structure #AceUnitRunnerData_t directly contains the buffer for message formatting.
 *      Otherwise the structure only contains a pointer which has to be initialized by the user.
 *  </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * @warning AceUnit can define types for itself for exotic compilation environments where standard includes are not available or shall not be used.
 *          But though AceUnit can do that, this is strongly deprecated.
 *          This will certainly cause a lot of problems:
 *          - AceUnit "guesses" the types by assuming <code>short int</code> to be 16 bit and <code>long int</code> to be 32 bit.
 *            Especially about the second assumption AceUnit could be wrong.
 *          - Tools like lint are very picky about type definitions.
 *            For lint it makes a difference if a type of size 16 bit is defined as <code>short int</code> or <code>int</code>.
 *            For sure lint will find something to complain about if you let AceUnit define its own types instead of providing consistent types from your compilation environment.
