This is a test for using AceUnit recursively.

The directories C1, C2, C3 represent what you might call software components.
These components each have their own test sets in a "tests" subdirectory.
AceUnit shall recursively find all tests in all "tests" subdirectories.
The "tests" subdirectories may group their fixtures in packages.
Each package is represented by a subdirectory the same way as in Java.
All test cases shall be executed.
