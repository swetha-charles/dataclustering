/** Full Logger implementation that logs plain text messages.
 * The format of the messages is suitable for processing in popular text editors like EMacs or Vim.
 * It is the same as that of error messages yielded by most popular compilers like gcc or javac.
 * The format is:
 * <p><code><var>filename</var>:<var>linenumber</var>: error: in <var>symbolnname</var>: <var>message</var></p>
 * For example:
 * <p><samp>foo.c:30: error: Expected X to be 15 but was 13.</samp></p>
