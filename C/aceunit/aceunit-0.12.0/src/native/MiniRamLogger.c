/** Mini Ram Logger implementation that logs messages to RAM with as little memory consumption as possible.
 * The format of the messages is suitable for postprocessing to convert it into the same format as that of {@link FullPlainLogger.c}.
 * This Logger also could serve as a template if you want to create your own logger that e.g. logs by writing to a NVM like EEPROM or Flash.
