/** Prints a formatted message.
 *
 * This is a minimalistic implementation of printf.
 * It is guaranteed to support the following subset of the formatting specified in C99:
 * - The only supported character set and encoding is US-ASCII-7.
 * - The only supported flag is <code>0</code>.
 * - Setting the field width is not supported. The field width is fixed to not given for conversions <code>s</code> and <code>%</code>, 8 for <code>x</code>, <code>X</code> and <code>p</code>.
 * - Precision is not supported.
 * - Length modifier is supported within the limited range 1..8.
 * - The only supported conversion specifiers are: <code>s</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>p</code> and <code>%</code>.
 * - The only supported argument types are <code>char *</code>, <code>void *</code> and <code>long int</code>.
 * More features may be supported by different implementations.
 *
 * @note You should not use this for regular test logging.
 *       Something worth logging is something worth checking, so instead of looking at the log to see whether what's going on is correct, you should programmatically verify your assumptions.
 *       That's what testing is about.
 *
 * @param format  Format string.
 *
 * @return The number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if an output or encoding error occurred.
 *
