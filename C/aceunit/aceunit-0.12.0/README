ACEUNIT README
==============

AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit): a comfortable C code unit test
framework. AceUnit is JUnit 4.x style, easy, modular and flexible.  AceUnit can
be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development.


DESIGN GOALS
============
* "User-compatible" with JUnit 4.x - works and behaves like JUnit 4.x annotation
  based testing.
* No framework overhead in test code.  That's because of the JUnit compatible
  design but is worth noting explicitely, as this is what distinguishes this
  framework most from other frameworks for unit testing C code.

 
REQUIREMENTS
============
Java 1.5 is required to run the generator.
Java 1.6 is required to build the generator.
C89 is required for AceUnit.
If C99 is available, AceUnit can make use of it.
A C99 environment is strongly recommended.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================
src/doc
    The source code of the documentation.

src/java
    The source code of GenTest, which is the code generator for the AceUnit
    test framework.

src/native
    The source code that you need for building programs with AceUnit.
    This also contains tests which can be used to test AceUnit with itself.
    Also, these tests are examples of how to use AceUnit.

src/native/test
    Several unit tests where AceUnit is tested with itself.
    This is excellent examples of how to use AceUnit.
